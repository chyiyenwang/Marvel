# Search Marvel
### About
Search Marvel is an app created to be like a wiki page.  This app uses JSON files found from the MarvelousDB app which is based off of the Marvel API.  I used the JSON files because there were errors with the Marvel API that were not able to get settled in time for this project.

### Technologies Used
* Express/Node.js
* Mongoose for MongoDB
* AngularJS
* Socket.io
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

### Approach Taken
I wanted to create an API that could help people search for their favorite Marvel character.  I first found JSON files for the characters and imported them into MongoDB and then proceeded to make the character show page.

### Upcoming Additions
* Add responsive design for pictures on the index page.
